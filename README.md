# Hi there, I'm Sebastien Melki üëã

**VP Engineering at [Anghami](https://play.anghami.com) & [OSN+](https://osnplus.com)**
*Building the future of entertainment streaming in MENA*

## About Me

I'm a backend engineer passionate about building scalable systems and developer tools. After graduating from McGill University with a Computer Engineering degree (2012-2016), I discovered Anghami through a hidden console message on their website - a moment that changed my career trajectory from aspiring musician to tech leader.

Today, I lead engineering efforts at Anghami and OSN+, where we're creating the region's premier entertainment platform combining music and video streaming for over 120 million users.
